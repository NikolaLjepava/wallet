# Wallet Service API

A backend wallet application for managing player balances, sessions, and transactions.

## Current Status: In Development

This is an active learning project where I'm building a production-ready wallet service with Node.js, TypeScript, and PostgreSQL. README will be updated regularly

### What's Implemented So Far:
-  Database schema design with proper constraints and indexes
-  Basic project structure with TypeScript
-  Database connection setup with pg-promise
-  Player repository with create/find methods

### Tech Stack:
- **Runtime:** Node.js with TypeScript (strict mode)
- **Framework:** Express.js
- **Database:** PostgreSQL with raw SQL (pg-promise)
- **Testing:** Jest


### Next Steps:
- [ ] Implement wallet creation service
- [ ] Add session management
- [ ] Build transaction system with proper locking
- [ ] Create REST API endpoints
- [ ] Write integration tests
